    <h3>People</h3>
    <p>The web is no longer made of pages and quirky utilities,
      it's made of people, opinions, personalities, and apps focused on the improvement of one's life.
      At the core of any product, respect and understanding of the customer's needs and desires is essential.
      It's my belief that developers need to fully understand their customers to build a quality product.</p>

      <h5>Know Your Customer</h5>
      <p>
        <span>Everyone involved in the engineering of a product</span>
        <strong>needs</strong>
        <span>to know their customer. A product that scratches your own back is a huge plus.</span>

      <h5>Listen to the Customer</h5>
      <p>
                <span>Customers can be annoying. They complain about things that most of us wouldn't even think of.
                  It doesn't matter. If you build a product that breeds confusion, you need to change it.</span>
